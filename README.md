# From Basics of  NLP to ChatGPT and Beyond -->
Sharing detailed list of NLP topics to get in-depth knowledge; 

### 1. NLP kick-start:
- Text cleaning process, RegEx, NLTK and Spacy toolkit.
- Feature extraction: tokenization, bag of words, tf-idf, word embeddings.
- Basic NLP tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Topic modelling, Named entity recognition. (This can be solved with basic NLP and ML knowledge only)

### 2. Embeddings: 
What I feel is you should consider embeddings part in-dept. word2vec, glove etc

### 3. Deep Learning back-bone models: 
CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU models, Please consider Seq2Seq(Encoder-Decoder) models, latest Large language models are highly depend on Seq2Seq mechanism.

### 4. GenAI and LLM: 
- Introduction of GenAI
- Attention Mechanism - Self-Attention, Multi-Head Attention
- Transformer Model
- Variants of Transformer models - BERT(Encoder part), GPT(Decoder part), Flan-T5(Encoder-Decoder)
- ChatGPT: GPT, reinforcement learning, reward model.
- Training for LLM models - What is Transfer Learning, Pre-training and Fine-Tuning for specific tasks
- Inference part - Prompt Engineering, In-Context learning.
- Model Evaluation and Benchmarking
- Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning (quite effective when we've computation power limitations)
